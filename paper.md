# Introduction

As one of the most widely read and beloved fantasy novels of all time, J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" has captured the imagination of generations of readers. While many view the story as a work of fiction, some scholars have argued that it is, in fact, a work of non-fiction, with deep historical roots and real-world implications. In this paper, we explore the evidence that supports the idea that "The Lord of the Rings" is a work of non-fiction, and contrast it with the evidence that suggests that the Bible is a work of fiction. Through careful analysis of both texts, we hope to shed new light on the nature of truth and storytelling in the modern world.

# Background Research

The idea of classifying "The Lord of the Rings" as a work of non-fiction is not a new one, and has been debated by scholars and fans alike for many years. Proponents of this view argue that Tolkien's world-building is based on extensive research into real-world mythology, linguistics, and history, and that the story itself contains many elements that reflect the realities of our own world. For example, Tolkien drew heavily on Norse and Celtic mythology, as well as his own experiences fighting in World War I, to create the characters and events of his epic tale. Additionally, the themes of power, corruption, and the struggle for freedom and justice that run throughout the book are deeply rooted in historical events and ongoing struggles in the real world.

In contrast, the Bible has been widely accepted as a work of religious fiction, with its stories and teachings serving as a guide for the faithful rather than as a record of actual events. While some religious scholars maintain that certain elements of the Bible are based on historical fact, there is little consensus on what these elements might be, and much of the book's content remains shrouded in myth and legend.

To support our argument that "The Lord of the Rings" is a work of non-fiction and the Bible is a work of fiction, we will draw on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including critical analyses of both texts, historical accounts of the time periods in which they were written, and interviews with experts in literature, religion, and mythology. We will also examine the reception of both texts by audiences and critics, and explore how each has been interpreted and reinterpreted over time. Through this comprehensive investigation, we aim to provide a nuanced and compelling argument for our position.

# Sources

In order to support our argument that "The Lord of the Rings" is a work of non-fiction and the Bible is a work of fiction, we will draw on a wide range of sources from various disciplines.

## Literary Analysis

We will utilize critical analyses of "The Lord of the Rings" by prominent literary scholars, such as Tom Shippey and Verlyn Flieger, to examine the underlying themes and meanings of the text. These analyses will help us to understand how Tolkien's work reflects real-world issues and experiences, and how it fits into the broader tradition of epic storytelling.

## Historical Accounts

To contextualize our discussion of "The Lord of the Rings," we will draw on historical accounts of the time period in which Tolkien was writing. These accounts will help us to understand the ways in which Tolkien's experiences in World War I and his observations of the rise of fascism in Europe influenced his writing. We will also examine historical accounts of the Norse and Celtic mythology that Tolkien drew on, as well as the medieval literature that inspired his work.

## Religious Scholarship

To support our argument that the Bible is a work of fiction, we will draw on the work of religious scholars who have studied the text from a critical perspective. These scholars will help us to understand the ways in which the Bible has been interpreted and reinterpreted over time, and how its stories and teachings have been used to support various political and social agendas.

## Interviews with Experts

We will also conduct interviews with experts in literature, religion, and mythology to gain a more nuanced understanding of both texts. These interviews will help us to explore the various ways in which "The Lord of the Rings" and the Bible have been interpreted and to understand how different perspectives can influence our understanding of these works.

## Reception and Interpretation

Finally, we will examine the reception of both texts by audiences and critics, and explore how each has been interpreted and reinterpreted over time. This will help us to understand how the meaning of a text can evolve over time, and how the context in which a text is read can shape its interpretation.
