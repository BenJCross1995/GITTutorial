# Introduction

As one of the most widely read and beloved fantasy novels of all time, J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" has captured the imagination of generations of readers. While many view the story as a work of fiction, some scholars have argued that it is, in fact, a work of non-fiction, with deep historical roots and real-world implications. In this paper, we explore the evidence that supports the idea that "The Lord of the Rings" is a work of non-fiction, and contrast it with the evidence that suggests that the Bible is a work of fiction. Through careful analysis of both texts, we hope to shed new light on the nature of truth and storytelling in the modern world.
